# Better Minecraft
Welcome to A Better Minecraft, a Fabric Vanilla+ modpack & OptiFine alternative with a few additional features. These include a better video settings UI, a Mods menu, a Just Enough Items\* crafting book experience, Fullbright, and an enhanced hunger bar.Â 

<p style="text-align: center;">~~~~~~~~ Main Features ~~~~~~~~</p>

Updates way faster than OptiFine.

You can join plugin-based or Vanilla servers without an issue.

Our graphics/performance enhancements is mainly powered by Sodium, with a couple other mods to help out.

The highly customizable video settings of OptiFine are also here, brought to you by a variety of different mods.

Shaders are supported by Iris Shaders, with 2 shader packs already installed.

Zooming is also here courtesy of Zoomify. For those who have used Zoomify before, you may know that it interferes with some of Minecraft's keybinds, but don't worry, as I have fixed those problems while keeping Zoomify's keybinds the same.
